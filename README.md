# pandas-challenge

I was able to get through the majority of the project but had a few small snags in completing all of the summary tables.

Some trends or observations that I was able to make from the data include -  
  1. as would be expected, the majority of the players are in the 15-29 age range, however the highest average spend came from the "ends" of the dataset, ages <10 and 35-40
  2. males were the largest group by gender but smallest in average spend per person in the game
  3. the top spenders had 3-4 times the average player spend
